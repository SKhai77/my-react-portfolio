            <p>
              Hello! My name is Sian Khai. I have been passionate about web
              development since 2006, and I learned some basic web design when I
              was in India. But I wasn't able to continue in the field due to my
              situation. I have been working as a ride-share driver since May
              2022. Before that, I worked for a non-profit organization for over
              5 years as an employment specialist for newly arrived immigrants
              and a financial coach.
